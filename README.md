## Specification

**Note: Remember this is a C++ project.**

Complete the following exercises, saving your solutions in the indicated files. 

1. Recall the following references, which will still be useful throughout the rest of the course.
    * [C++ Tutorial](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
    * [C++ Essentials](https://tfetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CppEssentials.pdf)
    * [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
1. In this assignment, you will look briefly at the set of [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_62_0.html). In particular, you will use the [uBLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Library)](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_62_0/libs/numeric/ublas/doc/index.html), which is a standard workhorse for numerical programming in C++. Skim through the documentation to get a feel for the large range of functionality that these libraries provide.
1. Examine the source code in ```src/blas``` carefully. 
    1. In a Jupyter notebook ```BLAS.ipynb```, explain the code in detail. How does this code compare in complexity to the code you wrote for Stack and Queue?
    1. Explain what the notation ```<type>``` means in, e.g., ```complex<long double>```.
    1. Are BLAS matrices row-major or column-major? How can you tell based on how the code is written?
    1. Write a new program that uses BLAS to create a complex plane in a similar way to your python code from before. Print the resulting matrix of complex numbers to the screen in a pretty way to demonstrate that your code works.
1. Examine the source code in ```src/matrix``` carefully. This code is a rudimentary implementation of what the BLAS matrix class may look like, using templates.
    1. In a Jupyter notebook ```Matrix.ipynb```, explain the code in detail.
    1. Explain what a template is in C++, and what it allows that is impossible in C.
    1. Explain what operator-overloading is, and which operators are overloaded here.
    1. Create a new method ```print()``` that prints the matrix to the screen. You may use the code in ```test_matrix.cc``` to get you started. Refactor ```test_matrix.cc``` to use your new method.
    1. Create a new method that multiplies two matrices together, by overloading the * operator. Test this method in ```test_matrix.cc```.
    1. Create a new method that adds a scalar value of type T to the matrix element-by-element, by overloading the + operator. Test this method in ```test_matrix.cc```.
    1. Create a new method ```save(string filename)``` that saves the matrix to a comma-separated-value (CSV) file, with one row per line.
    1. Use [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html) to verify that you have no memory leaks in your final working program. (You will have to edit the primary Makefile to change the CXXFLAGS to enable -g for debugging.)


## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

**
1. Use library to save time on develoment, but need to know the detail of the library, otherwise it is hard to debug when issues come out.
2. must define members or properties before using/defining them in source code, otherwise will report error ("not any members in class")

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.
